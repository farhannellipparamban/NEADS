    description: `
      Improper management of solid waste remains one of the most critical environmental challenges in urban and rural areas. 
      Increasing population, industrialization, and urbanization have led to the generation of vast amounts of solid waste, 
      much of which is improperly collected, transported, or disposed of.
      The Solid Waste Management Programme (SWMP) aims to establish an efficient, sustainable, and inclusive system for the 
      segregation, collection, transportation, recycling, treatment, and safe disposal of solid waste in [target area]. 
      This initiative aligns with national sanitation policies and the Sustainable Development Goals.
    `,
    objectives: [
      "To enhance public health, environmental sustainability, and urban cleanliness through an integrated solid waste management system.",
      "To strengthen local capacity for effective waste segregation, collection, and disposal.",
      "To promote waste reduction, reuse, and recycling at the household and institutional levels.",
      "To establish environmentally sound waste treatment and disposal facilities.",
      "To increase community participation and awareness in solid waste management practices.",
      "To improve monitoring, data management, and policy compliance in the solid waste sector.",
    ],
    outcomes: [
      "60–80% of waste properly segregated at source.",
      "Reduction of open dumping and burning.",
      "Increased recycling and composting rates.",
      "Improved urban cleanliness and reduced vector-borne diseases.",
      "Stronger institutional capacity and public participation.",
      "Compliance with national solid waste and environmental policies.",
