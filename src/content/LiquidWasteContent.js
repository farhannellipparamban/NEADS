    title: "Introduction",
    description: `
      Liquid waste—comprising domestic wastewater, grey water, industrial effluents, and sludge—poses a major challenge 
      to environmental health and public safety, especially in rapidly growing urban and rural areas. 
      Improper disposal contaminates water sources, spreads diseases, and degrades ecosystems. 
      The Liquid Waste Management Programme aims to establish sustainable, safe, and affordable systems for the collection, 
      treatment, reuse, and disposal of liquid waste in accordance with national sanitation policies and environmental standards.
    `,
    objectives: [
      "To improve public health and environmental quality through the effective management of liquid waste in [target area].",
      "To develop decentralized and affordable wastewater and sludge treatment systems.",
      "To strengthen institutional capacity for liquid waste management.",
      "To promote safe reuse of treated wastewater and sludge for agriculture or landscaping.",
      "To raise public awareness and community participation in proper waste disposal.",
      "To establish monitoring systems to ensure compliance with national and international standards.",
    ],
    outcomes: [
      "Reduction in untreated wastewater discharge.",
      "Improved public health indicators (e.g., reduction in waterborne diseases).",
      "Increased reuse of treated wastewater for agriculture and landscaping.",
      "Strengthened institutional capacity and community engagement.",
      "Compliance with environmental and sanitation standards.",
